# Let Me Land! - Scratch CS50 Project

I have finished my Version 1.0 of my scratch project.

Instructions: Use arrow keys to move the ship. Stay within earth as much as possible to earn score. Great exercise for fingers using arrow keys.

P.S. Thank you to CS50 of edx.org and HarvardX. As well as to icons8.com for free and fabulous icons.
